System Analysis: The system analysis involves, system specifications, system design and implementation, system validation, and system evolution.

System Specifications: Our team created the use cases of what the user wanted to see in the system. We mainly used a UML use case diagram to show the use cases and actors of our system.

System Design: We designed how each part of the system would interact and to show the behavior of our system. We mainly used uml diagrams, such as a sequence diagram and a class diagram to show the system design. Our system has a shared repository type architecture, so most of the use cases will interact the actors to the database.

System Implementation: To implement our system and turn it into code, we used java and sql languages along with the eclipse IDE and MySQL database to create our system. We mapped the class diagram onto the code, to create classes for each object, and applied frontend gui and a separate main class which includes methods that interact with the database.

Implementation and Testing: To compile our code and run it on other devices, we used the install4j tool to convert the executable jar files and source code to an executable file that will run on windows. The install4j also helped convert all the files into a .dmg file that will install the files as mac applications and windows applications. To test our project we used junit testing for the backend, and used manual testing for the frontend.
