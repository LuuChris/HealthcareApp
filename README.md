System Analysis: The system analysis involves, system specifications, system design and implementation, system validation, and system evolution.
System Specifications: Our team created the use cases of what the user wanted to see in the system. We mainly used a UML use case diagram to show the use cases and actors of our system.
System Design: We designed how each part of the system would interact and to show the behavior of our system. We mainly used uml diagrams, such as a sequence diagram and a class diagram to show the system design.
System Implementation: To implement our system and turn it into code, we used java and sql languages along with the eclipse IDE and MySQL database to create our system.
